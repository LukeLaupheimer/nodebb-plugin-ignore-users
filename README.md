![Alt text](/nodeplugins.jpg "Exodo plugins")

Plugin to ignore post from certain users.

You can ignore an user in when browsing a topic and he/she has post on its topic. At the left of his/her username will appear an icon of an eye, pressing that icon will ignore/unignore that user.

Froim his/her user profile you are able to ignore/unignore the user too, the option is located in the profile dropdown of the user.

From your profile page, you can see the list of users you are ignoring and you have the option to unignore them too from them.

When you have an user ignored, you will not see his/her posts, you will see a generic text telling you that user is ignored and the posts will appear faded itself.
